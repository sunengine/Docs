# Requirements to run

`SunEngine` can be run on `Windows`, `Linux` and` MacOSX` operating systems.

It is recommended to use `Linux` as the server operating system.

The following programs must be installed:

- [AspNet Core 3.1] (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) (SDK on the developer machine, Runtime on the server machine)
- [PostgreSQL] (https://www.postgresql.org) (in the future, support for other SQL sub)
- [NodeJs] (https://nodejs.org) (✻)
- [Npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/) (✻) (usually installed automatically with NodeJs)
- [Quasar CLI] (https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation) (✻)


Items marked (`✻`) are needed only for launch and assembly on the developer's machine and are not required on the server.

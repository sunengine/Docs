## What you need to run

SunEngine can be run on Windows, Linux, MacOs operating systems.

It is recommended that you use Linux as the server operating system.

To start the project, you must install the following programs:

    AspNet Core 3.1 (on the SDK developer machine, on the Runtime server machine)
    NodeJs (✻)
    Npm (✻) (usually installed automatically with NodeJs)
    Quasar CLI (✻)
    PostgreSQL (future support for other SQL subdirectories)

Items marked with (✻) are only needed to run and build on the developer's machine and are not required on the server.

- Article


## Category page

## Component Page

Component pages are:

`Posts` - output in the form of posts of materials from different categories in descending order of date (customizable)

`Activities` - output in the form of links of new materials and comments from different categories in descending order of date (categories for outputting new materials and categories for outputting new comments are set separately)

`Custom page` - a page with its own logic and code (can be made by developers according to individual requirements).

Currently, comments at the display level have a flat structure.

It is planned to improve the structure of comments to a 2 level tree.

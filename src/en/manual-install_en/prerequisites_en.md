# Requirements to run

`SunEngine` runs on` Windows`, `Linux` and` MacOSX`.

It is recommended to use `Linux` as the server operating system.

To start the project, you must install the following programs:

- [AspNet Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) (SDK on developer machine and Runtime on a server)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)   (future support for other SQL databases)
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org)   (✻)
- Npm   (✻)   (usually installed automatically with NodeJs)
- [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation)   (✻)

Items marked (`✻`) are needed only for launch and assembly on the developer's machine and are not required on the server.
